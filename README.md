## Test Results

During the experiment, the brute force script tried different passwords automatically.

In my test:

- Total attempts: 5
- Total time: 0.03 seconds
- Result: Password was not found (or found if correct password exists)

This shows that if a weak password exists in the system, it can be discovered quickly.

If the password list is bigger, the attack would take more time, but it could still succeed if there is no protection.

## Conclusion

This project helped me understand how brute force attacks work.

I learned that:

- Weak passwords are dangerous.
- Systems without login limits are vulnerable.
- Security protections are very important.

To improve security, the system should use password hashing, login attempt limits, and multi-factor authentication.

This project was developed only for educational purposes.
